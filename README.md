# PC Usage Tracker

PC Usage Tracker is a Windows application designed to help users monitor and manage their device usage.  
It tracks active time spent on applications — all processed locally and never transmitted externally.

  Monitor how long your PC has been active and which applications you've spent time on.

- **Local data processing**  
  All data stays on your device. Nothing is uploaded or shared.

  The application can run silently in the background to provide continuous tracking.

- **Clean, modern UI**  
  Built with WinUI for a smooth and responsive experience.
